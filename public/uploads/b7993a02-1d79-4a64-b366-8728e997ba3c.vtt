00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.559
um, you know, can 10,000 fans push a car?

00:00:02.559 --> 00:00:03.920
Yeah, that'd be a whole video.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.079
Now for me, how, how do I go online and be like,

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:09.119
hey, here's who I am.

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.000
Once our team matches theirs, then I drop it off.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.640
We downgraded to a consulting agreement just for insurance.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.359
For example, I watched Oppenheimer the other day.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:16.200
Great film, by the way.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.200
And afterwards I was like, huh, I wonder how a nuclear.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.420
When do I not see things?

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.280
How do I represent not only me,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.840
but us as the king in the.
